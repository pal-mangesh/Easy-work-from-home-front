        Invoices and Billing Service begins as soon as your payment is
        processed. You will be charged the full rate stated at the time of
        purchase, plus applicable taxes. Your subscription will renew
        automatically (not including lifetime membership purchases), on your
        renewal date, until you request termination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our charges for monthly and annual plans are posted on our Website and
        may be changed from time to time. If the changes affect existing users,
        they will be notified before the change takes effect. The account owner
        agrees to receive the invoices by electronic means. The invoices shall
        be visible in the Application if the account owner logs into the
        Account.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you upgrade to a higher tier plan during the billing cycle, a
        prorated fee between the rates specified in the subscription you
        previously selected and the fees specified in the subscription to which
        you have upgraded will be applied. You will either be charged on the day
        of the upgrade or in the following billing period for any upgrade to
        your subscription. If you request to downgrade to a lower tier plan
        during the billing cycle, the changes will take effect starting
        immediately after the request was processed by our billing department.
        Downgrading is only permitted between monthly subscriptions, once per
        billing period. Downgrading your paid account may cause the loss of
        Content, customer lists, or features, available to your account at your
        current plan. easy-workfromhome.com is not and will not be held liable
        for such loss.
        <br />
        <br />
        As long as you are a Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you
        will provide us with valid credit card information and authorize us to
        deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You will replace
        the information for any credit card that expires with information for a
        valid one. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that they
        are authorized to use that credit card and that any and all charges may
        be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected. If we are unable to
        process your credit card order, we will try to contact you by email and
        suspend your account until your payment can be processed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Termination of Contract Termination of the contract can be requested any
        time at support@easy-workfromhome.com only from the email address
        associated with the account. If this is not possible, we reserve the
        right to ask for additional information to prove ownership, such as but
        not limited to the last four digits of the credit card. The changes will
        take effect from the date and time of the email request. Inactive
        accounts will not be considered as terminated, unless a specific request
        is sent.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you terminate your membership within 30 days of your order, you will
        be eligible for a refund on your membership fees. Should more than 30
        days pass, your payment is non-refundable and your service will continue
        until the end of your subscription term.
        <br />
        <br />
        Only membership fees are refundable, all other purchases are
        non-refundable and are considered final.

        The client permanently and irrevocably waives any and all rights to
        enact a ‘chargeback’ (that is, a disputed, reversed or contested charge
        with the applicable bank, credit card or charge card) against payments
        that were made during the period of the contract and are dated before
        the date of the termination request, for any reason whatsoever. Any
        chargeback processed against charges for easy-workfromhome.com will
        result in full and complete termination of all easy-workfromhome.com
        licenses and accounts due to the significant costs involved in
