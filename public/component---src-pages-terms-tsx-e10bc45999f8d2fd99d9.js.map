You will be charged the full rate stated at the time of\n        purchase, plus applicable taxes. Your subscription will renew\n        automatically (not including lifetime membership purchases), on your\n        renewal date, until you request termination.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Our charges for monthly and annual plans are posted on our Website and\n        may be changed from time to time. If the changes affect existing users,\n        they will be notified before the change takes effect. The account owner\n        agrees to receive the invoices by electronic means. The invoices shall\n        be visible in the Application if the account owner logs into the\n        Account.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        If you upgrade to a higher tier plan during the billing cycle, a\n        prorated fee between the rates specified in the subscription you\n        previously selected and the fees specified in the subscription to which\n        you have upgraded will be applied. You will either be charged on the day\n        of the upgrade or in the following billing period for any upgrade to\n        your subscription. If you request to downgrade to a lower tier plan\n        during the billing cycle, the changes will take effect starting\n        immediately after the request was processed by our billing department.\n        Downgrading is only permitted between monthly subscriptions, once per\n        billing period. Downgrading your paid account may cause the loss of\n        Content, customer lists, or features, available to your account at your\n        current plan. easy-workfromhome.com is not and will not be held liable\n        for such loss.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        As long as you are a Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you\n        will provide us with valid credit card information and authorize us to\n        deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You will replace\n        the information for any credit card that expires with information for a\n        valid one. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that they\n        are authorized to use that credit card and that any and all charges may\n        be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected. If we are unable to\n        process your credit card order, we will try to contact you by email and\n        suspend your account until your payment can be processed.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Termination of Contract Termination of the contract can be requested any\n        time at support@easy-workfromhome.com only from the email address\n        associated with the account. If this is not possible, we reserve the\n        right to ask for additional information to prove ownership, such as but\n        not limited to the last four digits of the credit card. The changes will\n        take effect from the date and time of the email request. Inactive\n        accounts will not be considered as terminated, unless a specific request\n        is sent.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        If you terminate your membership within 30 days of your order, you will\n        be eligible for a refund on your membership fees. Should more than 30\n        days pass, your payment is non-refundable and your service will continue\n        until the end of your subscription term.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Only membership fees are refundable, all other purchases are\n        non-refundable and are considered final.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        You agree that before any purchase is made on easy-workfromhome.com,\n        that you have read our Earnings Disclaimer located in a link at the\n        bottom of our homepage.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        The client permanently and irrevocably waives any and all rights to\n        enact a ‘chargeback’ (that is, a disputed, reversed or contested charge\n        with the applicable bank, credit card or charge card) against payments\n        that were made during the period of the contract and are dated before\n        the date of the termination request, for any reason whatsoever. Any\n        chargeback processed against charges for easy-workfromhome.com will\n        result in full and complete termination of all easy-workfromhome.com\n        licenses and accounts due to the significant costs involved in\n        administration of managing chargebacks.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        easy-workfromhome.com is under no obligation to store your Content and\n        may delete your Account and your Content immediately upon termination or\n        may keep your Account and your Content for up to 60 days following the\n        last day of the month of termination.
